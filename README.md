## Overview

**AWCMaster** is an open-source GUI-based tool designed to help you create and edit native audio files for Grand Theft Auto V and FiveM. With an easy-to-use interface and powerful features, this tool simplifies the process of customizing audio for your scripts and mods.

## Usage

**Install the latest Windows release** from [here](https://github.com/qyful/AWCMaster/releases/) or download the source files:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/qyful/AWCMaster.git
```

Then, navigate to the newly-created folder:

```console
$ cd AWCMaster/src
```

and run the `main.py` file:

```console
$ python main.py
```

**Then you're done!** There are some more advanced features such as flags, however the defaults are more than enough to get started creating your own native sounds for GTA V.
